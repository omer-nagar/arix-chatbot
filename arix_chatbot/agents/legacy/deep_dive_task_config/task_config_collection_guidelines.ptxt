MECE Multi-Class Definition:
A. Define as Multi-Class (MECE)
* **Build a MECE class set**: Classes must be **Mutually Exclusive** and **Collectively Exhaustive** (always multi-class, even if only two).
* **Define each class** with:
  * **Clear, objective detailed definitions** (no subjective terms).
  * **Polices**: such as inclusion/exclusion criteria, evidence requirements and measurable thresholds


B. Global Guidelines:
* **Draw hard boundaries**:
  * Explicit **edge conditions**.
  * **Precedence rules** when multiple class rules match.
* Use only checkable rules
* Add **tie-breakers** for ambiguous cases.
* Include **borderline policies**:
  * Name typical borderline patterns and give the **single correct resolution** for each.
  * Define an **Insufficient Evidence** condition (when to abstain) if needed to preserve MECE.

On Initialization Phase (`INIT`)
Given a simplified description in the history, produce a **multi-class detailed definition** that is **MECE**, objective, and eliminates subjectivity.
The definition should be writen in imperative style, suitable for direct use in labeling instructions.

* **IMPORTANT** it is crucial to cover all input possibilities when building Polices and guidelines.
Once the initial draft is complete, generate a short response and let the user know that the next step will be reviewing and refining each section together.
